# Wallet CLI Completion

Completion scripts for the LSSA `wallet` command.

## ZSH

Works with both vanilla zsh and oh-my-zsh.

### Features

- Full completion for all wallet subcommands
- Contextual option completion for each command
- Dynamic account ID completion via `wallet account list`
- Descriptions for all commands and options

Note that only accounts created by the user auto-complete.
Preconfigured accounts and accounts only with `/` (no number) are not completed.

e.g.:

```
▶ wallet account list
Preconfigured Public/7wHg9sbJwc6h3NP1S9bekfAzB8CHifEcxKswCKUt3YQo,
Preconfigured Public/6iArKUXxhUJqS7kCaPNhwMWt3ro71PDyBj7jwAyE2VQV,
Preconfigured Private/3oCG8gqdKLMegw4rRfyaMQvuPHpcASt7xwttsmnZLSkw,
Preconfigured Private/AKTcXgJ1xoynta1Ec7y6Jso1z1JQtHqd7aPQ1h9er6xX,
/ Public/8DstRgMQrB2N9a7ymv98RDDbt8nctrP9ZzaNRSpKDZSu,
/0 Public/2gJJjtG9UivBGEhA1Jz6waZQx1cwfYupC5yvKEweHaeH,
/ Private/Bcv15B36bs1VqvQAdY6ZGFM1KioByNQQsB92KTNAx6u2
```

Only `Public/2gJJjtG9UivBGEhA1Jz6waZQx1cwfYupC5yvKEweHaeH` is used for completion.

### Installation

#### Vanilla Zsh

1. Create a completions directory:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions
   ```

2. Copy the completion file:

   ```sh
   cp ./zsh/_wallet ~/.zsh/completions/
   ```

3. Add to your `~/.zshrc` (before any `compinit` call, or add these lines if you don't have one):

   ```sh
   fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)
   autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
   ```

4. Reload your shell:

   ```sh
   exec zsh
   ```

#### Oh-My-Zsh

1. Create the plugin directory and copy the file:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/wallet
   cp _wallet ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/wallet/
   ```

2. Add `wallet` to your plugins array in `~/.zshrc`:

   ```sh
   plugins=(... wallet)
   ```

3. Reload your shell:

   ```sh
   exec zsh
   ```

### Requirements

The completion script calls `wallet account list` to dynamically fetch account IDs. Ensure the `wallet` command is in your `$PATH`.

### Usage

```sh
# Main commands
wallet <TAB>

# Account subcommands
wallet account <TAB>

# Options for auth-transfer send
wallet auth-transfer send --<TAB>

# Account types when creating
wallet account new <TAB>
# Shows: public  private

# Account IDs (fetched dynamically)
wallet account get --account-id <TAB>
# Shows: Public/...  Private/...
```

## Bash

Works with bash 4+. The `bash-completion` package is required for auto-sourcing from
`/etc/bash_completion.d/`; without it, source the file directly from `~/.bashrc` instead.

### Features

- Full completion for all wallet subcommands
- Contextual option completion for each command
- Dynamic account ID completion via `wallet account list`
- Falls back to `Public/` / `Private/` prefixes when no accounts are available

Note that only accounts created by the user auto-complete (same filtering as zsh — see above).

### Installation

#### Option A — source directly from `~/.bashrc` (works everywhere)

```sh
echo "source $(pwd)/completions/bash/wallet" >> ~/.bashrc
exec bash
```

#### Option B — system-wide via `bash-completion`

1. Copy the file:

   ```sh
   cp ./bash/wallet /etc/bash_completion.d/wallet
   ```

2. Ensure `bash-completion` is initialised in every interactive shell. On many Linux
   distributions (e.g. Fedora) it is only sourced for **login** shells via
   `/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh`. For non-login shells (e.g. a bash session started
   inside zsh), add this to `~/.bashrc`:

   ```sh
   [[ -f /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]] && source /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
   ```

3. Reload your shell:

   ```sh
   exec bash
   ```

### Requirements

The completion script calls `wallet account list` to dynamically fetch account IDs. Ensure the `wallet` command is in your `$PATH`.

### Usage

```sh
# Main commands
wallet <TAB>

# Account subcommands
wallet account <TAB>

# Options for auth-transfer send
wallet auth-transfer send --<TAB>

# Account types when creating
wallet account new <TAB>
# Shows: public  private

# Account IDs (fetched dynamically)
wallet account get --account-id <TAB>
# Shows: Public/...  Private/...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Zsh completions not appearing

1. Check that `compinit` is called in your `.zshrc`
2. Rebuild the completion cache:

   ```sh
   rm -f ~/.zcompdump*
   exec zsh
   ```

### Account IDs not completing

Ensure `wallet account list` works from your command line.
